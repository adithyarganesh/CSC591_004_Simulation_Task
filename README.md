# CSC591_IOT_Analytics_Simulation_Task_2

# Important Information
Code has not been run in eos and the main libraries used are numpy and matplotlib

# Description
The code to perform simulation of real and non-real time signals has been implemented and the results 
are present in Results.pdf


# Instructions

First, add pip access iso that we can install the required libraries and then install the numpy library for file generation.
Another mode of implementation is with the jupyter notebook that has been attached as Task_3_araghug.ipynb

Commands:

    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
    python get-pip.py
    pip install numpy

Once the three commands have been successfully run, we can go ahead with the implementation

# Implementation
The code is implemented in a single script called SimulationTask2.py. This code will be
called as follows:

    python Task3.py 

# Results
All the results have been analysed and the analysis metrics have been saved as images in the same folder

# Issues
pip/ pip3 based on Python usage 
Since both the tasks use the same script, two separate files have not been created and instead two output files are generated separately for each task when the script is run.
